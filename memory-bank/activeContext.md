# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing authentication middleware for protected routes
- Resolving TypeScript issues in auth middleware implementation
- Setting up core authentication infrastructure

## Recent Changes
- Created authentication middleware with three main components:
  - `useAuthGuard`: Hook for route protection
  - `useUser`: Hook for user state management
  - `withAuth`: HOC for component-level authentication

## Active Decisions
- Using React hooks for authentication state management
- Implementing HOC pattern for protected components
- Leveraging localStorage for token management
- TypeScript integration for type safety

## Current Challenges
- Resolving TypeScript linter errors in auth middleware
- Need to ensure proper type definitions across auth system
- Balancing type safety with code readability

## Next Steps
1. Resolve remaining TypeScript issues in auth middleware
2. Test authentication flow end-to-end
3. Implement protected routes using the middleware
4. Add error handling and user feedback
5. Document authentication patterns and usage
